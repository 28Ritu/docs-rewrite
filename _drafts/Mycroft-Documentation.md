# Documentation Home

Welcome to the documentation for all elements of the Mycroft - the open source voice assistant.

Our documentation, just like our source code, is open source, [and you can contribute to improving it here](https://github.com/MycroftAI/docs-rewrite). Alternatively, please rate our documentation and leave comments on how we can improve.

@TODO The links here won't work yet because they're linking to GitHub; fixing them will be one of the steps of the documentation implementation plan.
