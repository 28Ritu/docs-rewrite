We've declared a winner to our <a href="https://community.mycroft.ai/t/mascot-mycroft-contest" target="_blank">Mycroft Mascot Contest</a>. It was a difficult decision, as we had so many great entries, but we finally settled on the Mascot above (submitted by <a href="https://community.mycroft.ai/users/ronnietucker" target="_blank">ronnietucker</a>). It looks great and I'm sure we'll start placing him in as many places as possible in the near future!

Those who submitted entries to the contest are being rewarded with a 3D-printed version of the winning submission, so that they can proudly display it on their desk as a physical token of appreciation from the Mycroft team. We hope that those in the community with artistic abilities will continue to be involved and share their ideas and designs with us going forward!

Thanks again to everyone who participated!
