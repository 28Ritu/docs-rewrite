That's right friends, we've made it halfway to our goal - but we can't stop now. In order to make an A.I. for everyone we have more work to do! But it's time for the team, fans, and backers to pat themselves on the back for bringing this dream one step closer to a reality. So we, once again, extend our thanks and deepest gratitude to our supporters.

But the team hasn't stopped developing Mycroft either, this week we hacked on some code, <a href="https://mycroft.ai/new-partnership-with-lucid-labs/" target="_blank">finalized the partnership with Lucid Labs</a>, and began planning some community initiatives that we hope to get rolled out soon. The feedback we've gotten has continued to be fantastic, and we've taken the responses we've gotten from our growing community and looked at the best ways to implement the ideas into the project. We're glad so many smart and creative people support the project, and we can't wait to talk to everyone moving forward!

If you are as excited at Mycroft's success as we are, please take the time to share our <a href="http://bit.ly/mycroftai" target="_blank">Kickstarter campaign</a> with friends and family, on social media, and anywhere else you can think of. But, also, let us know what you think we can do in order to get the word out about our project, we're open to suggestions.

Thanks for being awesome, and stay tuned! If you haven't backed us yet, head over to our <a href="http://bit.ly/mycroftai" target="_blank">Kickstarter and do so</a>!
