If you have an idea that would be of interest to a Mycroft user then now is your <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScDWFJA6IY1AzlL2t_Rdpp1V2UbQiKCmgn13xbUDXWyI-i1mA/viewform">chance to present</a>.

We are looking for a wide variety of topics so please do not limit yourself. Submissions are due February 15th and we will let presenters know by February 20th.

Mycroft World Congress will be held in lovely downtown Kansas City. We will have group lodging rates so please <a href="email:media@mycroft.ai">contact us</a> for details.  You will have the opportunity to meet the founders and work with other Mycroft enthusiasts.

We can't wait to meet you and learn what you will make with Mycroft.
