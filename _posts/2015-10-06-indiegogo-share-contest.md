As many of you remember, during our Kickstarter campaign we ran a contest with the help of the Ubuntu community wherein we asked fans and backers to share the link to the Kickstarter as much as possible, and the people whose links got the most clicks would be rewarded. We promised the top "sharer" a Mycroft Extendable unit, and the top 3 winners their own personalized message in Mycroft's longterm memory as an Easter Egg of sorts.

Following our successful Kickstarter campaign <a href="http://igg.me/at/mycroftai/x/9533694" target="_blank">we moved to Indiegogo's InDemand service</a>. Now folks can pre-order a Mycroft through this site whenever they want. So far we've had a decent amount of traffic to our InDemand page, but we are hoping to continue to sell units as a means to fund development and bring on more awesome team members to push the project forward at a faster pace, and all around just make things more awesome!

In order to ensure that we continue to get new backers and promote the project, we are running a second referral contest on Indiegogo, called the "Share Mycroft Contest". The top three sharers will win a Mycroft unit, no strings attached. The way to get credit for sharing is very simple.
<ol>
	<li>Log into Indiegogo <strong>(THIS STEP IS VERY IMPORTANT FOR YOU TO GET CREDIT!)</strong></li>
	<li>Click on the link button on the <a href="http://igg.me/at/mycroftai/x/9533694" target="_blank">Mycroft Indiegogo page</a> (Picture below). Once again, make sure you are logged into Indiegogo.</li>
	<li>Share the link that pops up in the window, that is a personalized link that is tied to your Indiegogo account. You will show up in our dashboard for the number of folks you drive to the site.</li>
</ol>

The contest will run for one month, the end date will be Friday, November 6th. After that date we will tally up who did the best and announce the winners (likely the following week).

If you have any questions or feedback please <a href="https://community.mycroft.ai/t/share-mycroft-contest" target="_blank">post them in our community in the relevant post</a> (and check out the other topics while you are over there!).
