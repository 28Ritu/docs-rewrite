<span style="font-weight: 400;">This year we’re happy to announce Mycroft will again be at </span><a href="https://conferences.oreilly.com/oscon/oscon-tx"><span style="font-weight: 400;">OSCON</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the O’Reilly Open Source Convention! OSCON takes over Austin, Texas with the spirit of collaboration straight from the Austin Convention Center. It's a great place learn about the newest open source projects, to network, and see talks from great speakers. Most importantly, it will give you the chance to talk to members of the Mycroft AI team! From May 9th to the 11th, Arron and Karl from Mycroft AI will be in Austin at the convention. Canonical is once again graciously hosting us, so check out the Ubuntu booth on the Expo Floor and chat with two of the developers for <a href="http://mycroft.ai">Mycroft</a>.</span>
