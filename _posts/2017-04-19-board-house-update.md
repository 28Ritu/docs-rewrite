Keeping everyone in the loop, we just got an update today from the board house as they wrap up the main boards.
<h3>Message from the production floor</h3>
<blockquote>We are now finishing the dip process this week. I have sent pictures of this below. It has taken longer than we thought do to so many single pin connectors ... 12,000 pcs, 1 x 12 Female Header 3,100 pcs, extended length 2 x 20 straight headers. Now we are in final test and any rework that needs to be done, then packaging and shipping. We expect to ship on or about the 25<sup>th</sup> of this month.</blockquote>
That should get the boards in our hands a couple days later, then we can begin assembling the finished product. Things are getting close!
