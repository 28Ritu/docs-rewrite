We did it. The Mycroft team successfully completed the intensive Sprint Accelerator powered by Techstars. What began on February 22nd as a way to take Mycroft to the next level culminated on Demo Day May 24th at the Kauffman Center.

During that time we met some amazing mentors, entrepreneurs, and investors.  We had three software releases with the last being <a href="https://github.com/MycroftAI/mycroft-core">Mycroft Core</a>. Our team grew to 8 full time and 6 part time staff. We took countless meetings, worked more hours than we thought possible, and gave our Demo Day pitch so many times that our CEO began to dream he was on stage.  On May 24th he presented before a live audience of hundreds and nailed it.

The team from <a href="http://www.startlandnews.com/">Startland News</a> was in attendance and took some beautiful photos.

During Demo Day we heard from David Brown, co-founder of Techstars and Sprint CEO Marcelo Claure. We even got a <a href="https://twitter.com/marceloclaure/status/735296451249635328">shoutout</a> from Marcelo on twitter which was pretty cool.

Techstars is over but we are far from finished. Work continues on our Kickstarter and <a href="https://igg.me/at/mycroftai/x/1728487">Indiegogo</a> campaigns. We are on course for an on time delivery. This has been an amazing year and we are glad you joined us.
