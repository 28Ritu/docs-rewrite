<div><span style="color: #000000;">Our team here at Mycroft AI is now working with Jaguar Land Rover at the Jaguar's Portland Oregon open source technology center.  Jaguar Land Rover has made a $110,000 strategic investment in Mycroft and is providing full time engineering support.</span></div>
<div><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></div>
<div><span style="color: #000000;">Our CTO Steve Penrod is overseeing the Portland effort with support from Karl Fezer, our latest engineering team member.  I am also on site working with Jaguar's team and planning Mycroft's automotive strategy.</span></div>
<div><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></div>
<div><span style="color: #000000;">Engineers from Jaguar and Mycroft have already made significant progress on vehicle integration.  We are now using voice control to control vehicle features like windows, locks and the convertible top.  Our team is also working on core technologies like enhanced keyword recognition, a skills management framework and intent parsing powered by machine learning.</span></div>
<div><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></div>
<div><span style="color: #000000;">According to JD Powers in <a href="http://www.jdpower.com/resource/video-vehicle-voice-recognition-failing-car-management-briefing">vehicle voice control is failing</a> and is the most dissatisfying experience reported by vehicle buyers.  That is why Mycroft is an important technology for this industry.  By building robust data models and running them in the vehicle we are solving this problem.</span></div>
<div><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></div>
<div><span style="color: #000000;">We are also excited to announce that Mycroft is now a member of <a href="https://www.genivi.org/genivi-members">GENIVI</a>, an open standards body that includes companies like Honda, Hyundai, Volvo, Daimler, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover. This sets the company on a path to being the automotive standard for natural language processing.</span></div>
<div><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></div>
<div><span style="color: #000000;">Everyone here at Mycroft is excited by the opportunity to work with a company with such a storied history.  We are looking forward to bringing open source solutions to Jaguar and other GENIVI members.</span></div>
