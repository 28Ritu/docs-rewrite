With Mycroft we want to innovate and push the boundaries of what people think is possible with an open source solution. We are challenging the idea that only large companies can innovate in this space. We are creating a product in Mycroft that marries the latest and greatest in voice recognition and machine learning with the open source ethos behind so many great projects already.

Our latest announcement is a continuation of those ideals. We are happy to announce that we are partnering with Ubuntu and will be shipping with Snappy Core Ubuntu as the operating system powering Mycroft. Snappy Core Ubuntu will allow us to ship secure devices that utilize the latest and greatest containerization and app delivery technologies. Ubuntu's parent company is changing the landscape of IoT and the cloud, and we are ecstatic to be a part of this revolution.

We will be utilizing Snappy in order to manage app installation through "Snappy Apps" (more on that coming soon). We think this will make development for the platform easier, and help developers get their Mycroft apps out to users quickly and easily.

We can't wait to share more about this moving forward, so stay tuned!
