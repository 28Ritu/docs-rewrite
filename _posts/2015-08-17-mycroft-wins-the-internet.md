Mycroft has been taking the Internet by storm the past few opening days of our Kickstarter campaign. We've been featured in multiple media outlets and have already had 282 great people back our project, getting us near $40,000 - and we've still got 23 days to go! The support we've gotten from friends, family, and fans has been amazing and has helped us immensely in carrying the project forward. We're getting new opportunities every day, that are fun and exciting, from interviews on <a href="http://www.jupiterbroadcasting.com/86422/vulkan-the-metal-slayer-lup-105/" target="_blank">favorite podcasts</a> and in big publications (this one is a secret for now). We've also been covered by articles in <a href="http://news.softpedia.com/news/mycroft-is-an-ai-for-your-home-powered-by-raspberry-pi-2-and-ubuntu-snappy-489280.shtml" target="_blank">Softpedia</a>, <a href="https://insights.ubuntu.com/2015/08/14/meet-mycroft-open-source-artificial-intelligence-powered-by-snappy/" target="_blank">the Ubuntu Insights blog</a>, and <a href="http://siliconprairienews.com/2015/08/mycroft-launches-kickstarter-to-create-artificial-intelligence-for-everyone/" target="_blank">Silicon Prairie News</a>.

Among the feedback we've received various questions and comments about Mycroft, all of them very interesting and insightful! We're so glad we are getting to know so many really awesome folks who are passionate about open source and A.I. just like we are! While we are in the process of making an awesome product, we are also building a community that will help us make Mycroft an A.I. for everyone, and on that front I'm hoping that we will have more to share about how to get involved in the near future!

But we still have a ways to go, we need those who are reading this post to share the Kickstarter campaign on social media and with friends and family who might be interested in the project. We also are relying on our fans to help us reach out to news outlets who may be interested in talking about Mycroft, or if you have any feedback, let us know by Emailing us at <a href="mailto:media@mycroft.ai" target="_blank">media@mycroft.ai</a> or tweeting at us <a href="https://twitter.com/mycroft_ai" target="_blank">@mycroft_ai</a>.
