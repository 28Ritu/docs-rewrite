It's midnight, the day of the Kickstarter, and our team is so excited, it's hard to go to sleep! So much hard work has gone into making Mycroft work and getting ready for our campaign. As a result we're eager to share this project with everyone!

I've decided to provide some eye candy for those reading this post. So here is the inside of a prototype unit!

As you can see there are a lot of cables! Fortunately the final model will have much of that taken care of (stay tuned for more details on that)! We have lots more to share, so to get the most up-to-date details, back us on Kickstarter today (we launch at 8am Central)!
