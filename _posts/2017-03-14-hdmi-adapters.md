Finally, we are receiving parts that will make the Mark 1 and allow us to fulfill our Kickstarter and Indiegogo orders. Many of these components will be shipped to our manufacturing center but some will be added by us just prior to shipping.

We have received our HDMI adapters. We had these custom built because of the required positioning of the Raspberry Pi. As you can see, we needed these in order to bring the HDMI port to the rear of Mycroft.
