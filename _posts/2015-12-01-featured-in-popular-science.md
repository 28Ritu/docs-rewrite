- After seeing the team work together at KC Startup Weekend, Karl Watson decided to transition from an advisor to a staff member. Karl will be taking over the duties of CFO freeing Kris to focus on marketing. Karl has spent the last fifteen years as a partner and COO of GPW &amp; Associates, LLC - an engineering consulting firm specializing in electrical and mechanical engineering. Before that he was the CFO of DiscoverME where he closed $2.7 million in funding and managed the legal and administrative processes. Prior to joining DiscoverME Karl was the director of planning for Payless Shoe Source where he directed the allocation of $1.1 billion annually.

- The hardware team is in the home stretch. The latest enclosure is off the printer and we have prototype boards completed for both the amp and i2s audio interface.
