Some big news today! The <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Raspberry Pi Foundation</a> has released the latest version of the Pi - the <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/raspberry-pi-3-on-sale/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Raspberry Pi 3</a>. The Pi 3 has 802.11n WiFi, Bluetooth 4.0, Bluetooth LE and a 64 bit 1.2 GHz quad core processor - all at the same price as the Pi 2.

We are testing Mycroft with the Pi 3 and if all goes as planned we will be shipping our backers Mycroft units with a Raspberry Pi 3 at its core. Â We'd like to thank the Raspberry Pi foundation for all of the work they do to bring makers, hackers and students such a great platform.
