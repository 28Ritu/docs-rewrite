Join us this weekend at Maker Faire Bay Area. We will have our newly produced Mark 1 units on display and several team members on site to answer questions.

This is the first year we are presenting at the Bay Area Faire but we have had a booth in our home city of Kansas City two years running. We plan to be there for a third year this summer.

Make sure to stop by the booth and say hi.

From <a href="http://makerfaire.com/makerfairehistory/">Maker Faire History</a>:

"Maker Faire is the Greatest Show (and Tell) on Earth—a family-friendly festival of invention, creativity and resourcefulness, and a celebration of the Maker movement.

Part science fair, part county fair, and part something entirely new, Maker Faire is an all-ages gathering of tech enthusiasts, crafters, educators, tinkerers, hobbyists, engineers, science clubs, authors, artists, students, and commercial exhibitors. All of these “makers” come to Maker Faire to show what they have made and to share what they have learned."
