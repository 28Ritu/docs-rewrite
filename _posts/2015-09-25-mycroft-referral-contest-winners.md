As many of you reading this might remember, the Ubuntu community teamed up with the Mycroft team during our Kickstarter to run a referral contest. The contest centered around folks creating a custom link that pointed to our Kickstarter page, and the people who got the most clicks would be the winners and get awesome prizes!

Well the results are in, and the Mycroft referral contest winners are as follows:

<strong>3rd Place: </strong>Rudy (Launchpad: <a href="https://launchpad.net/~cm-t" target="_blank">https://launchpad.net/~cm-t</a>) - Rudy has been pretty active and engaged in the Mycroft project on Google+, glad to see him as a winner!

<strong>2nd Place: </strong>Jelmer Prins (Launchpad: <a href="https://launchpad.net/~justcarakas" target="_blank">https://launchpad.net/~justcarakas</a>) - Jelmer has messaged the team with good feedback and questions, looking forward to his custom message!

<strong>1st Place: </strong>Daniel McGuire (Launchpad: <a href="https://launchpad.net/~danielmcguire" target="_blank">https://launchpad.net/~danielmcguire</a>) - Daniel is the first place, grand prize winner! He gets a Mycroft Extendable and a custom message!

Rudy, Jelmer, and Daniel are still coming up with custom messages for Mycroft to have in his longterm memory, we look forward to sharing them in the near future.

We are always looking at new contests to run in order to engage our growing community and share Mycroft with the world, so please feel free to share ideas and feedback with us on what you think we should do moving forward over at <a href="https://community.mycroft.ai" target="_blank">our community</a>.

We want to give a big thank you to our winners, the Ubuntu community, and everyone else who participated in the referral contest, we couldn't have done it without you!
