We are starting a new regular entry here.  Every week I'll post a "What's New" with the latest developments in the Mycroft software world.  This week I'll catch up a little with the previous week of interesting developments, too...
<h2>This week</h2>
<h4><span style="color: #4990e2;">KDE Desktop</span></h4>
<ul>
 	<li>We began working with KDE Desktop development team to make Mycroft a part of their Plasma environment!  Read more about it here tomorrow.</li>
</ul>
<h4><span style="color: #4990e2;"><a href="https://github.com/MycroftAI/mycroft-core/releases/tag/release%2Fv0.8.4" target="_blank">mycroft-core 0.8.4/0.8.5 <i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a></span></h4>
<em>NOTE:  0.8.5 was only a minor release to correct an error that occurred while producing packaging</em>
<ul>
 	<li>Added configuration setting for command line used to play WAV and MP3 audio.  <a href="https://github.com/MycroftAI/mycroft-core/issues/511">PR #514</a></li>
 	<li>BUGFIX:  For Picroft, used the above setting to specify the hardware device used by 'aplay'.  This fixes an ALSA/PulseAudio issue which would lockup for 30 seconds fairly regularly when playing back a WAV (such as when Mycroft speaks).  <a href="https://github.com/MycroftAI/enclosure-picroft/pull/5/files">PR #5 (enclosure-picroft)</a></li>
 	<li>More verbose Skill service logging, such as where Skills are being loaded from and what intents are registered.  <a href="https://github.com/MycroftAI/mycroft-core/pull/513">PR #513</a></li>
 	<li>A wake word detected sound has been added for better interaction.  Thanks to contributor "tmajibon" for getting this going! <a href="https://github.com/MycroftAI/mycroft-core/pull/472">PR #472</a></li>
 	<li>Added resource mechanism for customizing sounds, such as the wake word ding.  <a href="https://github.com/MycroftAI/mycroft-core/pull/504">PR #504</a></li>
 	<li>When pairing a device it could be difficult to understand the spoken code. Added a NATO-inspired phonetic spelling, such as "C as in Charlie".  <a href="https://github.com/MycroftAI/mycroft-core/pull/502">PR #502</a></li>
 	<li>Load data files for skills automatically when loading the skill. Skills no longer need to call self.load_data_files(dirname(file)) <a href="https://github.com/MycroftAI/mycroft-core/pull/499">PR #499</a></li>
 	<li>The Adapt intent parser version used has been upgraded to 0.3.0.  Major changes include a ContextManager for intent parsing.  <a href="https://github.com/MycroftAI/mycroft-core/pull/499">PR #496</a>, see also <a href="https://github.com/MycroftAI/adapt/pull/46">Adapt PR #46</a></li>
</ul>
<h4><a href="https://home.mycroft.ai" target="_blank"><span style="color: #4990e2;">home.mycroft.ai <i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></span></a></h4>
<ul>
 	<li>BUGFIX:  Github login was often failing due to a change in the github API</li>
</ul>
<h2>Last week</h2>
<h4><a href="https://github.com/MycroftAI/mycroft-core/releases/tag/release%2Fv0.8.3" target="_blank"><span style="color: #4990e2;">mycroft-core 0.8.3 <i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></span></a></h4>
<ul>
 	<li>Weather and Time Skills now using location information as entered for device on home.mycroft.ai.  The timezone is automatically derived from the locations.  <a href="https://github.com/MycroftAI/mycroft-core/pull/492">PR #492</a></li>
 	<li>CLI interface made more friendly.  Now shows output as text as well as playing the audio.  <a href="https://github.com/MycroftAI/mycroft-core/pull/494">PR #494</a></li>
</ul>
<h4><a href="https://mycroft.ai" target="_blank"><span style="color: #4990e2;">mycroft.ai website <i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></span></a></h4>
<ul>
 	<li>All new website!  This is a complete refresh from the ground up.</li>
</ul>
<h4><a href="https://home.mycroft.ai" target="_blank"><span style="color: #4990e2;">home.mycroft.ai <i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></span></a></h4>
<ul>
 	<li>BUGFIX: Pairing code entry on some browsers allowed lowercase, breaking the pairing.</li>
 	<li>Created a 404 page (see <a href="https://home.mycroft.ai/#/nothinghere">https://home.mycroft.ai/nothinghere</a>)</li>
 	<li>Bottom logo now links to <a href="https://mycroft.ai">https://mycroft.ai</a></li>
