People reach out to us a lot. We get emails, tweets, messages on Facebook, even Slack messages. Most of them are related to development or sales of some type. But every once in a while we get a message from a non-developer asking how they can help. Well, here are some ideas:

Social Media Ambassador: Mycroft needs two or three ambassadors on each social media platform. Mainly Twitter and Facebook. These sites receive questions often that need to be answered by someone with a little bit of technical knowledge but not necessarily a developer. So often questions go days or even weeks before we are able to get them answered by someone on the technical team as they are busy making Mycroft better.

Design assistant: We are in the process of updating our logo and overall design. You may have noticed that we updated our blog recently. Next up is logo and font. We need a few small tasks completed.

Reddit Ambassador: This is a such a great site and we would love to spend more time there. We have a subreddit that receives a small amount of traffic and could use a little love and attention. The right person would be active on Reddit already and understanding of the dos and don'ts of Reddit.

General Ambassador: Â We could use help sharing the word about Mycroft. There are so many sites on the internet where people share ideas, ask questions, and have conversations. Let us know your favorite and you can be the Mycroft Ambassador for that site.

Data Analysis: We have a small list of data from a recent survey. This information could be valuable if we could turn it into actionable items. The right person would need to be technical but not necessarily a programmer. This information could be sorted by one person or 20. The more help we get the faster we can take action on the information.

That is all for today but we are finding new ways to help all of the time.

If you would like to help us just a little or a lot, please <a href="mailto:founders@mycroft.ai">email</a> and let us know your skills. We would love to welcome you to the team.
