We have received the first shipment of our custom boards! Work has begun to put all of the parts together to make the Mark 1 units.

We expect to begin shipping soon to all of our Kickstarter and Indiegogo backers.

As we previous posted we are working with <a href="https://mycroft.ai/backerkit/">Backerkit</a> to help with fulfillment. Expect an email shortly asking to verify your information.

Getting Mark 1 in the hands of our backers has been a dream and an goal for a long time.

We can't wait to see what you do with your Mark 1 unit!

Great thanks to all of our loyal supporters!
