<b><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/aiforeveryone/mycroft-an-open-source-artificial-intelligence-for/posts/1336401" target="_blank">We're announcing our first stretch goal today</a>!</b> If our campaign reaches <b>$125k</b> we will release Mycroft software to <b>control your Linux desktop</b>. This will enable you to launch applications, control media, and change settings with just your voice.

We talked to the Ubuntu team, and with their help we will ensure it is easy to enable Mycroft and use it through Unity. We will also reach out to other communities creating Linux desktop environments to enable deep integration.

<b>We have prototyped this functionality internally and have had initial success</b>. With further development we will ensure it works across many different desktop environments. We hope our fans will help us hit this stretch goal so that the Linux desktop can keep up with the likes of Windows 10 (which offers Cortana), and Mac OS X's eventual implementation of Siri on the desktop.

<b>We're asking our backers and fans to share this great news</b>. With your help we can hit this goal and change the way people interact with their Linux desktop! If you haven't backed us yet, <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/aiforeveryone/mycroft-an-open-source-artificial-intelligence-for" target="_blank">head over to our Kickstarter campaign and do so now</a>!

Thanks all and stay tuned for more great news!
