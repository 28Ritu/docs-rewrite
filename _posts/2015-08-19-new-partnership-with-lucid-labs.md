We're excited to announce today that we have formed a partnership with <a href="http://www.lucidlaboratories.com/" target="_blank">Lucid Labs</a>, in order to enhance the audio capabilities of Mycroft!
<p class="western" align="justify">Lucid Labs develops high end digital to audio converters (DACs), DMX lighting controls, phonograph preamplifiers, and audiophile quality headphone amplifiers. Their CMOY headphone amplifier was recently declared one of the top five portable headphone amplifiers <a href="http://lifehacker.com/five-best-portable-headphone-amplifiers-1722800379" target="_blank">by Lifehacker.com</a>.</p>
<p class="western" align="justify"><a href="https://mycroft.ai/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/lucid_top_pick.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-605" src="https://mycroft.ai/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/lucid_top_pick.jpg" alt="lucid_top_pick" width="389" height="259" /></a></p>
<p class="western" align="justify">Besides making great products, Lucid has a history of developing products that integrate with Mycroft's main hardware component, the Raspberry Pi. <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1721521097/lucid-labs-raspberry-pi-dac" target="_blank">After achieving more than 2,500% of its fundraising goal</a> Lucid recently shipped its Raspberry Pi DAC to Kickstarter backers. Backers have given the Raspberry Pi DAC rave reviews citing the high quality and low cost of the product.</p>
<p class="western" align="justify">The Mycroft team will be working with Lucid engineers to ensure that Mycroft can provide top shelf audio quality to end users. Lucid will also assist with further development of Mycroft's audio pickups and noise reduction technologies.</p>
Â We're excited to be working with Stephen Vincent and his team to bring Lucid's audio expertise to the Mycroft project. Lucid has a record delivering quality audio products to Kickstarter backers on time.

So, if you consider yourself an audiophile and haven't backed us yet, head over to <a href="http://bit.ly/mycroftai" target="_blank">our Kickstarter campaign and support us now</a>!
