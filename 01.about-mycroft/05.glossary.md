# Mycroft Glossary

* **Device** - the platform you have Mycroft installed on. This might be using an **Enclosure**, like the Mark 1, or on a Raspberry Pi, or it might be on a Linux desktop. Each **Device**  needs to be **Paired** with your Mycroft Home account before it can be used.

* **Enclosure** - a hardware implmentation of Mycroft. Examples include the Mark 1 and Picroft. 

* **Skill** - when Mycroft hears the **Wake Word**, then an **Utterance**, Mycroft will try to find a **Skill** that matches the **Utterance**. The **Skill** might fetch some data, or play some audio, or speak, or display some information. If Mycroft can't find a **Skill** that matches the Utterance, he will tell you he doesn't understand.

* **Utterance** - an Utterance is how you interact with Mycroft. An **Utterance** is a command or question -  like "What's the weather like in Kansas City?" or "Tell me about the Pembroke Welsh Corgi".

* **Wake Word** - the Wake Word is the phrase you use to tell Mycroft you're about to issue a command. You can configure your wake word in your [Mycroft Home](https://home.mycroft.ai) account.
