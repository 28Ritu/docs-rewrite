# Mark 1

The Mark 1 device is an **Enclosure** for Mycroft, based on Raspberry Pi. It is designed as a reference hardware device, and is able to be easily modified, hacked and extended.

[Mark 1 devices are available in the Mycroft Shop](https://mycroft.ai/shop/?add-to-cart=31440).

_NOTE: Mark 1 devices are currently suitable for hardware hobbyists, developers and hackers. They are not average-consumer ready, but we are anticipating they will be in early 2018. If you have a Mark 1 and you're a general consumer, please leave Mark 1 on a shelf for a few months._)

### Prerequisites

This section of documentation assumes the following:

* That you have a Mycroft Mark 1 hardware **Device**
* That you are comfortable connecting devices to WiFi networks
* That you are comfortable issuing basic Linux commands

### Getting Started

When you received your Mark 1, you would have received a [blue-colored Getting Started guide (PDF, 290Kb)]().

Connect the Mark 1 power supply to a power outlet, and to the Mark 1 device. _NOTE: If you are in a country other than the USA, you will need a power adapter to fit the power outlets in your country_

The Mark 1 will boot up. It will then Speak:

`I need to be connected to the internet. Plug in a network cable, or connect to the SSID Mycroft with the password 12345678 and go to http://start.mycroft.ai`

#### Getting Mark 1 connected to the internet using a network cable

Plug the Mark 1 into your router using an ethernet cable.
@TODO This didn't work on my Mark 1, so I'm not sure what should happen when the Mark 1 is connected to the router via network cable.

#### Getting Mark 1 connected to the internet using Wifi

Using your computer or a mobile device, connect to the Wifi SSID `MYCROFT` using the password `123456787`. Once you are connected to this SSID, go to the web page [http://start.mycroft.ai](https://start.mycroft.ai). A list of available WiFi networks will be presented. Select the WiFi network that you wish to connect the Mark 1 to, and enter the WiFi password. Mark 1 will attempt to connect to the WiFi network.

_NOTE: Mark 1 cannot connect to WiFi networks that operate in the 5GHz band. You must select a WiFi network that operates in the 2.4GHz band._

@TODO I don't know what the limitations are around the WiFi networks that Mycroft can connect to - for instance, can Mycroft connect to WiFi networks that use certain types of authentication like WEP, or enterprise WPA2-PSK with things like Radius that are used in the enterprise? Don't know, flagging as @TODO

### Pairing the Mark 1

Once the Mark 1 is connected to the internet, a **Registration Code** will be Spoken, and displayed on the Mark 1's LED panel.

[View the home.mycroft.ai documentation to learn how to add your **Device** to home.mycroft.ai](/03.your-home.mycroft.ai-account/01.your-home.mycroft-account.md).

Once paired, you can then use [basic **skills**](../03.your-home.mycroft.ai-account/02.basic-commands.md).

### Mark 1 menu options

You can access the Mark 1 menu by pressing the top button for two seconds. Turn the top button anti-clockwise to scroll through menu options, then press the button to select that option.  

The available menu options are:

* ILLUM: This option allows you to control the brightness of Mark 1's Eyes, on a scale of 0 (eyes off) to 30 (maximum brightness). The *Auto* setting will set the brightness to 30, which is the maximum setting.

* WIFI: This option allows you to connect or re-connect Mark 1 to your WiFi. This option is useful if your router changes, or your WiFi password changes, or you're moving your Mark 1 to a new location.

* REBOOT: This option will reboot your Mark 1. _NOTE: The reboot is immediate_. This option is useful if you're experiencing issues with your Mark 1, or may be required as part of troubleshooting measures.

* OFF: This option will put your Mark 1 into Standby Mode. You won't be able to use the **Wake Word** or make **Utterances** while Mark 1 is in Standby Mode. To wake Mark 1 up from Standby, press the top button for two seconds.

* TEST: This option will immediately run a test sequence on your Mark 1. This option may be required as part of troubleshooting measures. To move through each of the tests, press the top button. Continue pressing the top button to exit the test sequence.

* SSH: This option allows you to enable [SSH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell) connections to the Mark 1 Device, or to block SSH if it's enabled.

* LEARN: This option allows you to enable the Learn functionality within Mycroft. If you've also opted-in on home.mycroft.ai, and Learn functionality is enabled, then Mycroft will record your voice when Speaking the **Wake Word** and **Utterances**. This data is then used anonymously to _train_ Mycroft to better recognize the **Wake Word** and **Utterances**.

* RESET: This option resets Mark 1 back to a factory default state. You may need to do this for troubleshooing, or if you're giving your Mark 1 to someone else. _NOTE: If you're resetting your Mark 1, remember to remove the Device from home.mycroft.ai so that the Pairing is removed also_

* DEMO: If this option is selected, Mark 1 will provide a short demonstration of functionality, whilst channelling his secret desire to be Eminem :-)

### Hardware information

### Common tasks performed on the Mark 1

#### Installing Skills on the Mark 1

[Please refer to the information here](/03.your-home.mycroft.ai-account/02.basic-commands.md#installing-new-skills)

#### Connecting to the Mark 1 via SSH

* First, ensure that you've enabled SSH access.
* Ensure you know the IP address of your Mark 1 Device on your network. A handy way to do this is to install the IP Address **Skill**, and then Speak:

`hey mycroft, what's your IP address?`

`here are my available IP addresses: wlan IP address ... Those are all my available IP addresses`

* Open up your favorite terminal program, like PuTTy on Windows, or a new terminal on Linux
* `ssh pi@IPADDRESS`
* The default password is `mycroft`, so enter this when prompted.
* If you have successfully logged in via SSH you will see a command prompt like the one below:

```
$ ssh pi@192.168.0.13
pi@192.168.0.13's password:

pi@mark_1:~ $
```

You are now connected to the Mark 1 via SSH.

#### Changing the password for the default user via SSH

@TODO for discussion - I don't really want to include this because it will make troubleshooting basic errors much harder if beginner level developers change the pi user password. If people are advanced, they will figure out how to change the password.  

#### Setting up SSH to the Mark 1 using SSH keys

If you would like to set up SSH access to  your Mark 1 device using SSH keys instead of a password, then follow [this guide on the Raspberry Pi documentation](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/ssh/passwordless.md).

#### Accessing the command line interface (CLI) of the Mark 1

If you are SSH'd into the Mark 1 device, you are able to issue commands using the command line interface (CLI) instead of using voice. This bypasses the Speech To Text (STT) component of Mycroft.

`python -m mycroft.client.text.main --quiet`

You will now be able to type **Utterances** into the CLI.

![Issuing commands to Mark 1 from the command line](../img/mark1-utterances-from-command-line.png "Issuing commands to Mark 1 from the command line")

#### Enabling the LEARN function

The Learn functionality

If you've also opted-in on home.mycroft.ai, and Learn functionality is enabled, then Mycroft will record your voice when Speaking the **Wake Word** and **Utterances**. This data is then used anonymously to _train_ Mycroft to better recognize the **Wake Word** and **Utterances**.

To enable the Learn functionality:

1. Make sure that you've checked the 'Opt In' checkbox at [home.mycroft.ai](https://home.mycroft.ai), Settings -> Basic.

![Adding a new Device](../img/opting-in-open-dataset.png "Opting in to help build the Mycroft Open Dataset")

2. Next press the top button on your Mark 1. Turn the button to LEARN. Press the top button again. Turn the button to ALLOW. Mycroft will Speak:

`I will now upload interaction data to help make me smarter`

#### How to reimage a Mark 1 Device

@TODO Not sure how to do this

#### Keeping your Mark 1 Device updated

Your Mark 1 device will check for updates around every hour. If new software is available, Mark 1 will automatically download the updates and apply them.

There's nothing else you need to do.
