# Troubleshooting and known errors

This section is grouped by Device to help you quickly find the information you need.


## Help us to help you

When you contact Mycroft for support, we may ask for some of the following information:

* What type of Mycroft **Device** you're using, such as Mark 1, Picroft, KDE Plasmoid and so on
* Whether your **Device** was **Paired**
* Your home.mycroft.ai account details
* Information from your Mycroft logs

## About the Mycroft logs

The Mycroft logs each follow a standard format, being:

* A timestamp
* The function or action that was called
* The **level** of the error, which can be one of:

  * DEBUG - incidental information used for debugging purposes
  * INFO - informational log entries which do not indicate an error  
  * WARNING - an error occurred, but it did not stop execution of the **Skill** or process
  * ERROR - an error occurred, and it stopped execution of a **Skill** or other process
  * CRITICAL - a significant error occurred, and it halted execution of the Mycroft functionality itself

### How to find the Mycroft logs

#### Mark 1

  On a Mark 1 **Device**, first `ssh` into the Mark 1.

  @TODO: link to instruction here on SSH'ing into the devices

  The logs on a Mark 1 are held at `/var/log/`

  To find the specific Mycroft logs, run the following Linux command:

  `ls -las | grep -i Mycroft`

  This command lists all the log files with 'Mycroft' in the file name.

  Example:

  ```
  pi@mark_1:/var/log $ ls -las | grep mycroft
     20 -rw-r--r--  1 mycroft root    17136 Oct 16 15:52 mycroft-audio.log
  22808 -rw-r--r--  1 mycroft root 23348347 Oct 17 10:19 mycroft-enclosure-client.log
  38336 -rw-r--r--  1 mycroft root 39249935 Oct 17 10:19 mycroft-messagebus.log
  24564 -rw-r--r--  1 mycroft root 25147196 Oct 17 10:19 mycroft-skills.log
     28 -rw-r--r--  1 mycroft root    23272 Oct 16 15:52 mycroft-speech-client.log
    584 -rw-r--r--  1 root    root   590008 Oct 17 10:00 mycroft-update.log
     84 -rw-r--r--  1 mycroft root    84493 Oct 16 12:50 mycroft-wifi-setup-client.log
  ```

#### Picroft

On a Raspberry Pi 3 running Picroft, first `ssh` into the Picroft.

@TODO: link to instruction here on SSH'ing into the devices

The logs on a Picroft are held at

@TODO: haven't build a Picroft yet, will need to fill this in


#### Linux

On a Linux device running Mycroft for Linux, the logs are held at;

`scripts/logs`
relative to where mycroft-core was installed.

* When Mycroft speaks
* When the Text to Speech (TTS) cache is hit
* When volume is increased or decreased

### mycroft-cli.log

This log is primarily used on Linux installations of Mycroft and contains information on actions such as:

* Errors and warnings with Mycroft services
* When a **Fallback** cannot handle an **Intent**

### mycroft-enclosure-client.log

This log contains information on actions such as:

* Loading of configurations for the **Enclosure**
* Altering properties of the **Enclosure**, such as the Eyes or Mouth on a Mark 1
* Activities related to the **Enclosure** Display Manager

### mycroft-messagebus.log

This log contains information on actions such as:

* Messages sent between Mycroft components such as **Skills** and the **Enclosure** that Mycroft is running on
* Data generated through invoking and controlling **Skills**

### mycroft-skills.log

This log contains information on actions such as:

* The outcome of Mycroft attempting to load **Skills**, such as whether a Skill was successfully loaded, blacklisted (disabled by Mycroft) or failed to load
* When an **Utterance** is spoken, which **Skill** it was matched with, and the information provided to the **Skill**

### mycroft-wifi-setup-client.log

Some **Enclosures**, like the Mark 1, will create a WiFi hotspot when they are first set up. This log contains messages related to the creation and tear-down of the WiFi hotspot, as well as errors and information related to clients connecting to the WiFi hotspot.

## Troubleshooting Mark 1

#### Not connected to the internet

##### If your Mark 1 loses internet connectivity

If your Mark 1 has previously been connected to the internet, and loses internet connectivity, it will Speak

`I have lost connection to the internet`
