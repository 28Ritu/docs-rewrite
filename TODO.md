# Documentation TODO

The objective of this file is to document the items flagged as @TODO as I go through the documentation so I come back to them and ensure they're resolved before the documentation is put live.

### About Mycroft

- [ ] Release note - need to find a way to aggregate them from GitHub. This will need the GitHub API.


### Your home.mycroft.ai account

- [ ] Advanced settings - need to get someone to review what I've written about things like the Threshold and Dynamic Energy Ratio.

- [ ]

### Mark 1

- [ ] Mark 1 - how to connect using an ethernet cable
- [ ] Mark 1 - what are the limitations around what type of WiFi networks Mark 1 can connect to - for instance, can Mycroft connect to WEP networks, enterprise WPA2-PSK with Radius authentication etc.
- [ ] Mark 1 - how to reimage the Device
- [ ] Mark 1 - how to keep the Device updated - I've put something in there, but I'm not sure how accurate it is - needs Dev Team to give it the once over.

### Picroft

- [ ] Picroft - how to keep updated - is burning a new disk image to SD card the best approach?

### Mycroft for Linux

- [ ] Linux - should people be connecting headphones and microphones through USB or Bluetooth? Is there any difference or preference? Is this information the same as for Picroft?
- [ ] Linux - what are the other installation options for Mycroft on Linux - there are the installers that @AIIX provided, and I think there's an `apt-get` package. Will need to clarify.
- [ ] Not sure what the easiest way is to keep Mycroft for Linux updated - is it as simple as doing a `git pull` from the remote repo?
- [ ] What are the common issues with Mycroft for Linux?
