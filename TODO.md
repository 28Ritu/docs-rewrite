# Documentation TODO

The objective of this file is to document the items flagged as @TODO as I go through the documentation so I come back to them and ensure they're resolved before the documentation is put live.

### About Mycroft

- [ ] Release note - need to find a way to aggregate them from GitHub. This will need the GitHub API.


### Your home.mycroft.ai account

- [ ] Advanced settings - need to get someone to review what I've written about things like the Threshold and Dynamic Energy Ratio. 

### Mark 1

- [ ] Mark 1 - how to connect using an ethernet cable
- [ ] Mark 1 - what are the limitations around what type of WiFi networks Mark 1 can connect to - for instance, can Mycroft connect to WEP networks, enterprise WPA2-PSK with Radius authentication etc.
- [ ] Mark 1 - how to reimage the Device
- [ ] Mark 1 - how to keep the Device updated - I've put something in there, but I'm not sure how accurate it is - needs Dev Team to give it the once over.

### Picroft

- [ ] Picroft - what happens once the image is burned? How does it boot?
- [ ] Picroft - how do you add it to Wifi?
- [ ] Picroft - how do you pair the Picroft?
- [ ] Picroft - how to keep updated - is burning a new disk image to SD card the best approach?

^ I'm going to have to build a Picroft to figure a lot of this out, which won't be a bad thing.
