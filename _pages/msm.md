## What is Mycroft Skills Manager - msm? 

Mycroft Skills Manager (msm) is a command line tool used to add, manage and remove **Skills** on any Mycroft installation. It can install any **Skill** listed on the [Mycroft Skills Repository](https://github.com/MycroftAI/mycroft-skills). `msm` is a handy tool for Developers and those who may frequently reconfigure, install and uninstall **Skills**. 

## Using Mycroft Skills Manager - msm

_NOTE: If you are using `mycroft-core` on Linux, then you will need to `cd` into `mycroft-core/msm` and call `msm` using `./msm [command]`_

To bring up a list of all available `msm` commands, SSH into your **Device** and then type `msm -h`: 

```
$ msm -h
msm: Mycroft Skill Manager
usage: msm [option] [repo | name]

Options:
  default                  installs the default skills, updates all others

  update                   update all installed skills
  search <name>            search mycroft-skills for match for <name>
  info <name>              shows information about the skill matching <name>
  info <repo>              shows information about the skill in the specified repo

Params:
  <repo>   full URL to a Github repo
  <name>   one or more substrings to match against submodule names
           in the https://github.com/MycroftAI/mycroft-skills repo

  msm search twitter
  msm search date-time-skill
  msm install "daily meditation"
  msm remove "daily meditation"
  msm install https://github.com/penrods/Wink.git
```


For instance to see information on a **Skill**, type: 

`msm info mycroft-mark-1`


To list all available **Skills**, type: 

`msm list`

This will show available **Skills**, and indicate which ones you have installed: 

```

skill-caffeinewiz
```


Search is very handy functionality if you're looking for a particular **Skill**: 

```
pi@mark_1:/opt/mycroft/skills $ msm search twitter
Possible match: twitter-skill
```
